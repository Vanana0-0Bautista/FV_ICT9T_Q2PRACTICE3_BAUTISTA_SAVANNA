                    <span class="lead"> Jujutsu Kaisen </span>, an action anime where all characters will either lose their fate or gain power from those cursed monsters who are deemed evil. One of the main characters, <span class="fst-italic text-decoration-underline">ITADORI</span>, will venture out as he ate of the cursed fingers which turns him into one the strongest characters in Jujutsu Kaisen. Going along, we will meet new people who be by his side, <span class="fw-bold"> Megumi and Nobara</span>, who he will meet in Jujutsu high. At first he was weak with his powers as it was unintentional that he became a user. We will see the strongest character, Gojo Satoru, his evil best friend, Geto Suguru, and the most evil cursed user who is inside Yujis body, Sukuna Ryomen. They will all face battles as they will lose their loved ones, its a battle of survival or death, the lucky and the unlucky.
